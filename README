Final Fantasy X & X-2 HD Checksum Repair Utility
===============
Computes PS3 decrypted game save checksums for the aforementioned games. Heavily based upon the provided source code found here: http://forums.pcsx2.net/Thread-Celsius-FFX-2-Save-game-editor?pid=182634#pid182634

The utility offers a passive resigning process via cmd line argument or drag & drop onto the exe as well as a simple GUI to navigate to the save file.

The former will only inform the user of an error but will otherwise remain completely silent, this is to allow 3rd party applications to make use of it more easily.
